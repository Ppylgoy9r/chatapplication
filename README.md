Introduction
WebSocket is a protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. Unlike traditional HTTP, which is request-response based, WebSocket allows both the client and server to send and receive data independently. This eliminates the need for continuous polling and significantly reduces the latency, making it ideal for applications that require real-time updates.

This application showcases the capabilities of WebSocket by implementing a [brief description of what your application does].
